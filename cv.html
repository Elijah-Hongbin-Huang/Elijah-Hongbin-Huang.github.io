<ul>
<li><p><strong>Master’s Thesis (Duke)</strong> Advisor: Prof. Philipp
Sadowski <em>Apr 2025–present</em><br/>
<em>Over-Competition and Market Volatility: A Theory of the Desire to
Win</em><br/>
Develop a new utility model in which the desire to win is defined as the
utility gain from exceeding others’ payoffs, to explain excessive
competition and market instability. Provide rigorous proofs of the
conditions under which no pure‐strategy Nash equilibrium exists, and
derive the corresponding mixed‐strategy probability distribution that
shows overproduction. Use experimental data to estimate the desire to
win using structural estimation and find that it is statistically
significant and large.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Research Assistant (Duke);</strong> Supervisor:
Prof. Ryan C. McDevitt <em>May 2025–present</em><br/>
<em>Private Equity Acquisition and Hospital Performance</em><br/>
Enhanced the fuzzy-matching algorithm to link hospital records with a
private-equity dataset. Disaggregated system-level deals into individual
hospital deals, then merged private-equity deals with hospital cost
reports to construct a hospital–year panel. Created a series of plots
for multiple subgroups to support analysis. Conducted replication
analyses for a published paper using updated data. Applied a staggered
DID approach to estimate treatment effects.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Research Assistant (Duke);</strong> Supervisor:
Prof. Anqi Zhao <em>May 2025–present</em><br/>
<em>Instrumental Variables and Design-Based Theory for Causal
Inference</em><br/>
Developed and proofread math-statistics proofs for propositions and
theorems. Developed R code to run simulations and generate violin plots
using both empirical and simulated data. Read and summarized papers on
instrumental variables, including interpretations of LATE. Compared
related literature and synthesized connections and differences across
studies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Research Assistant (Duke);</strong> Supervisor: Prof.
Daniel P. Gross <em>Dec 2024–Apr 2025</em><br/>
<em>Project on Patent, R&amp;D Funding, and Paper Citation</em><br/>
Conducted large-scale data integration and analysis by merging and
linking comprehensive datasets, including academic publications, global
patent records, and government funding data. Performed exploratory data
analysis, data visualization, and text analysis (e.g., title trends
across decades).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Undergraduate Thesis (SWUFE);</strong> Advisor: Prof.
Jianyu Yu <em>May 2023–May 2024</em><br/>
<em>Threshold Effect of R&amp;D Investment During Shock: Evidence from
COVID-19</em><br/>
Developed an R&amp;D competition model and computed the multiplayer Nash
equilibrium, applied the panel threshold model and staggered DID to
validate outcomes, concluded that firms above a size threshold
significantly increased R&amp;D spending during shocks, and estimated
the welfare loss.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Research Assistant (SWUFE);</strong> Supervisor: Prof.
Mengmeng Guo <em>Mar 2023–Jun 2024</em><br/>
<em>The Impact of Early-Life Earthquake Exposure on
Entrepreneurship</em><br/>
Collected and merged household survey data with earthquake disaster
data, scraped additional data for mechanism discussions using Python,
visualized data by creating heatmaps in Stata, ran regressions, examined
mechanisms, conducted heterogeneity analysis, and wrote part of the
manuscript.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Independent Research Paper (UCB);</strong> Advisor: Prof.
Benjamin Schoefer <em>Aug 2022–Dec 2022</em><br/>
<em>The Asymmetric Effect of Gasoline Prices on Electric Vehicle
Sales</em><br/>
Analyzed monthly data to assess the relationship between gasoline prices
and electric car sales. Used the autoregressive distributed lag model
(ARDL) to test asymmetric effects in multiple ways. Concluded that
consumers respond more strongly to increases in gasoline prices than to
decreases.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>International Mathematical Contest in Modeling
(MCM);</strong> Team Leader <em>Jan 2022–Feb 2022</em><br/>
<em>How Does Asteroid Mining Impact Global Inequality?</em><br/>
Led a team of three to develop a game-theoretic model assessing country
participation in asteroid mining. Analyzed supply and demand data of
minerals and conducted Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the impact on
global inequality.</p></li>
